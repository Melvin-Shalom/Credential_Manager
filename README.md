<h1>Credential Manager</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
A program for managing passwords was developed using Java and Python. The <strong>Cryptography</strong> module from Python was utilized to ensure data security, and the <strong>Flask</strong> framework was deployed to establish connectivity between Python and Java using API. Additionally, a <strong>virtual environment</strong> was set up to manage dependencies effectively. The required modules are documented in a file named <strong><em>Creden_Req.txt</em></strong>.

<h2>Step for Execution:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Activate the Virtualenv</strong><br>
    <small>Navigate to your project directory and activate the virtual environment:</small>
    <code>source venv/bin/activate</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Execute the PY_dec.py file</strong><br>
    <small>Execute the Python script:</small>
    <code>python PY_dec.py</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Execute the Main.java file</strong><br>
    <small>Execute the Java main program:</small>
    <code>javac Main.java && java Main</code>
  </li>
